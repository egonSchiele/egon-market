description: Update changelog with latest changes.

Please update CHANGELOG.md with all uncommitted changes. You can find those changes by running:

```bash
git diff
```

Add the update to the top of CHANGELOG.md along with the timestamp. For example:

```
## Nov 9 2025
Started changelog
```

Please keep updates concise. It is okay to sacrifice grammar for conciseness.
